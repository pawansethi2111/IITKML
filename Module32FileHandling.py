list1 = [1,2,3]
#list do not supprt Operation Broadcasting

print("list1 *4 =", list1 * 4)

#every element of list1 need to be procssed by this opeartion
#result wont be [4,8,12]

#result will be 1,2,3
#[1,2,3,1,2,3]

#if we wanted [4,8,12] we should have used  numpy library

#operation broadcats nahi horha #old style of array ==> old trend

#operation forecasting is a famous code

#big codes can be written in small codes
# for this we added advanced array which is numpy
# it supports the conecpt of operation broadcasting

#for this we need the numpy array
